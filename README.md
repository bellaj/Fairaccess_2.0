Please get in touch with the authors to know more about the project. this repos offer only a limited imlplementation using ethereum smart contract without offering the application interacting with it or the translator of access control politicy into Smart contracts.

The smart contract presented in the paper is Delpoyed in the testnet (deployment details) :  https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x4f74aaa63cbffd5dbcfeb4e8c4708aeaa56d7c0891a03d5c2f7fd7f9378abffb
